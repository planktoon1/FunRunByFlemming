# FunRunByFlemming
Inspired by my dads running races i created this website. 
However at some point i decided i wanted to redo the entire thing, and build another version where content management and responsiveness would be the main focus.

### Unused code
As i didn't finish the project there are big chunks of the code that i never got to fully implement.

### Stack

#### Frontend
React, Material UI, gsap, typescript, AWS Cognito (authentication for admin page).

#### Backend
(Backend is in a very unfinished state)
Node js, Serverless Framework, AWS, AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, DynamoDB, AWS Cognito.
